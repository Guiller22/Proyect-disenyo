            The woman in the painting is wearing a flowing white dress.
            A large piece of intricately patterned fabric is draped over
            the side. In her right hand she holds the chain mooring the
            boat. Her expression is mournful. She stares at a crucifix
            lying in front of her. Beside it are three candles.
            Two have blown out.
